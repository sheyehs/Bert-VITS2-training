# Bert-VITS2-training

This repo is based on the excellent [Bert-VITS2](https://github.com/fishaudio/Bert-VITS2) and only for the purpose of my school project.


## Python environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sheyehs/Bert-VITS2-training.git
cd Bert-VITS2-training
conda create -n vits2 python=3.10.0
conda activate vits2
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The cloning may take a few minutes because it needs to download model weights.
## Run the GUI
```bash
python webui.py
```
Refresh the webpage once if showing "Unable to connect".
## How to exam for English graders?
1. Open the Google Translation and translate your desired English sentences into Chinese(Simplified). For example this random sentence:

> I didn't expect so many people to see it, because I have a very thin voice and rarely talk. My friends and colleagues often say that I donâ€™t think I care about my students.

2. Cpoy the Chinese sentences to the input area

3. Choose the second character because her sound is more moderate.

6. Open a tool that can convert Chinese speech to text, for example [this website](https://convertspeech.com/zh-CN/). Then copy the conversion result.

7. Open the Google Tranlation again and translate the result back to English and you can compare the difference.

Looks not bad! It only misunderstands `voice` and `business` because these two words sound similar in Chinese: `shengyin` and `shengyi` if represented by Pinyin.
